# Technician Team System Design

## Research Summary

### Industry Best Practices (2024)

**Team Structure Patterns:**
- **Small Companies (1-5 techs)**: Every technician is a generalist
- **Medium Companies (6-20 techs)**: Specialization by service type (installation, repair, maintenance)
- **Large Companies (20+ techs)**: Teams with leads, skill-based routing, supervisor hierarchy

**Key Roles Identified:**
1. **Apprentice/Trainee** - Learning the trade, shadows experienced techs
2. **Junior Technician** - 1-3 years experience, handles basic repairs
3. **Technician** - 3-5 years experience, independent service work
4. **Senior Technician** - 5-7 years experience, handles complex diagnostics
5. **Lead Technician** - 7+ years experience, leads teams, mentors juniors
6. **Supervisor** - Manages multiple teams, coordinates dispatch

**Modern Dispatch Trends:**
- **Skill-Based Routing**: Match job requirements to technician expertise
- **AI-Powered Scheduling**: Optimize by location, skills, availability
- **Team Assignment**: Complex jobs assigned to lead + assistant(s)
- **First-Time Fix Rate**: Priority metric for quality service

### Phase 6: Skill-Based Routing

#### Job Complexity Assessment
```typescript
function assessJobComplexity(booking: Booking): {
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'expert';
  requiredSkills: TechnicianSkill[];
  recommendTeamSize: number;
  estimatedDuration: number;
} {
  // Simple: Filter cleaning, minor repairs (1-2 hours, 1 tech)
  // Moderate: Standard repairs, installations (2-4 hours, 1 tech)
  // Complex: Major repairs, ductwork (4-6 hours, 2 techs)
  // Expert: Commercial systems, complex diagnostics (6+ hours, team with lead)
}
```

#### Auto-Assignment Algorithm
```typescript
function findBestTechnician(
  job: JobRequirements,
  availableTechnicians: TechnicianProfile[]
): AssignmentRecommendation[] {
  return availableTechnicians
    .filter(tech => tech.isAvailable && tech.canWorkAlone)
    .map(tech => ({
      technicianId: tech.uid,
      matchScore: calculateMatchScore(job, tech),
      reasons: [
        hasRequiredSkills(job.skills, tech.skills) ? 'âœ“ Has required skills' : '',
        coversServiceArea(job.location, tech.serviceAreas) ? 'âœ“ Covers area' : '',
        tech.level >= job.minLevel ? `âœ“ ${tech.level} level` : '',
        tech.currentJobs < tech.maxJobsPerDay ? 'âœ“ Available capacity' : ''
      ].filter(Boolean)
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.matchScore - a.matchScore);
}
```

2. `technician_schedules` - Daily availability
3. `team_chats` - In-app messaging per job

### Fields to Add to Existing Collections:

**users (technician profiles):**
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  technicianLevel: 'senior',
  yearsOfExperience: 6,
  skills: ['ac_repair', 'electrical', 'preventive_maintenance'],
  certifications: [...],
  teamId: 'team_abc123',
  isTeamLead: false,
  isAvailable: true,
  serviceAreas: ['Accra', 'Tema'],
  maxJobsPerDay: 8,
  totalJobsCompleted: 243,
  averageRating: 4.7,
  firstTimeFixRate: 88.5
}
```

**bookings:**
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  assignmentType: 'team',
  teamId: 'team_abc123',
  leadTechnicianId: 'tech_001',
  assistantTechnicianIds: ['tech_002', 'tech_003'],
  requiredSkills: ['ac_installation', 'electrical'],
  complexity: 'complex',
  estimatedDuration: 6
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Firestore Rules:
```javascript
// Only admins and supervisors can create/edit teams
match /teams/{teamId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create, update: if hasRole('admin') || hasRole('supervisor');
  allow delete: if hasRole('admin');
}

// Technicians can only view their own team
match /teams/{teamId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.memberIds;
}

// Team chats only accessible to team members and customer
match /team_chats/{chatId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
}
```

## Next Steps

Start with the immediate need:
1. âœ… Create technician types and team models
2. âœ… Implement technician dropdown in admin dashboard
3. âœ… Add basic team management

Then expand to full team collaboration system!
