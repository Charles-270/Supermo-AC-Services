# Launch Chrome with Remote Debugging from WSL
# =============================================================================
# This script launches Chrome on Windows from WSL with remote debugging enabled.
# Required for Chrome DevTools MCP server to connect.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/launch-chrome-from-wsl.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Checks if Chrome is already running with debugging
#   2. Launches Chrome from Windows if not running
#   3. Verifies the connection is accessible from WSL
#   4. Provides troubleshooting tips if connection fails
