# Booking Flow Improvements

## Overview
Transformed the booking experience from a dialog-based flow to a dedicated full-page experience with sidebar navigation, improving usability and reducing scrolling.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created Dedicated Book Services Page
**File:** `src/pages/BookServicesPage.tsx`

- Full-page booking flow (not a dialog)
- Integrated with sidebar navigation
- Each step fits on one page without scrolling
- Fixed height content area (min-h-[600px])
- Better use of screen real estate

**Layout:**
- Sidebar on left (fixed, 64 width)
- Main content area on right
- Header with page title and sign-out
- Progress stepper at top
- Content card with white background
- Navigation buttons at bottom

### 2. Updated Sidebar Navigation
**File:** `src/components/layout/CustomerSidebar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- "Book Services" now navigates to `/book-services` (was `/customer`)
- Updated active state logic to work with new routes
- Simplified path matching

### 3. Cleaned Up Customer Dashboard
**File:** `src/pages/dashboards/CustomerDashboard.tsx`

**Removed:**
- "Book a Service" button from header
- "Confirmed" count badge
- "Book Service" button from empty state
- Booking dialog functionality
- Unused imports (BookingFormRedesigned, Plus icon, Badge usage)

**Updated:**
- Empty state message now directs users to sidebar menu
- Cleaner header without action buttons
- Focus on displaying bookings only

### 4. Added Routes
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

**New Routes:**
- `/book-services` - Book Services page (customer role required)
- `/customer/bookings` - My Bookings page (customer role required)

## User Experience Improvements

- Booking was in a dialog overlay
- Limited screen space
- Required scrolling within dialog
- Book button on dashboard page
- Confusing navigation

### After:
- Dedicated full-page booking experience
- Sidebar navigation for all customer actions
- Each step fits on screen without scrolling
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - "Book Services" = Create new booking
  - "My Bookings" = View existing bookings
- Better visual hierarchy

```

## Design Consistency
