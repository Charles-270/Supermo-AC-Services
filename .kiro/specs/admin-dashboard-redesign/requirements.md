# Admin Dashboard Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

The Admin Dashboard Redesign is a frontend-only modernization project that transforms the existing administrative interface into a responsive, accessible, and visually consistent experience. This project follows a structured audit-first approach: before any redesign work begins, a comprehensive UI/UX audit will be conducted to understand the current system's functionality, data flow, and user experience. The redesign will maintain 100% functional parity with the existing backend architecture while applying Google Stitch-inspired design patterns across all admin modules for both web and mobile devices.

## Glossary

- **Admin_Console**: The complete administrative interface system for platform management
- **UI_Audit**: Systematic evaluation of current interface structure, functionality, and user experience
- **Frontend_Redesign**: Visual and interaction layer updates without backend or logic modifications
- **Design_System**: Google Stitch-inspired visual and interaction patterns with consistent spacing, typography, and components
- **Responsive_Design**: Adaptive layouts optimized for desktop (≥1025px), tablet (641-1024px), and mobile (≤640px) breakpoints
- **Functional_Parity**: Maintaining all existing features, data flows, and backend integrations without modification
- **Accessibility_Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and contrast ratios
- **Audit_Report**: Documented findings of current system structure, issues prioritized as P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (cosmetic)
