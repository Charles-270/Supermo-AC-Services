# Phase 1 Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Phase:** Critical Pricing Fixes  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Summary

Phase 1 successfully removes the deprecated SERVICE_PACKAGES pricing model and implements the 4-service catalog with dynamic pricing from the admin-managed Service Pricing settings.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Technician Dashboard (`src/pages/dashboards/TechnicianDashboard.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Displayed 3 packages (Basic/Standard/Premium) with hardcoded prices
- Used `SERVICE_PACKAGES` constant

**After:**
- Displays 4 real services (Maintenance/Inspection/Repair/Installation)
- Fetches dynamic pricing from `getCurrentPricing()` on mount
- Shows technician earnings (90% of customer price) for each service
- Loading state while fetching prices

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Removed
import { SERVICE_PACKAGES } from '@/types/booking';

// Added
import { getCurrentPricing, type ServicePricing } from '@/services/pricingService';
import { SERVICE_TYPE_LABELS } from '@/types/booking';

// Dynamic pricing state
const [pricing, setPricing] = useState<ServicePricing | null>(null);

// Fetch on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const loadPricing = async () => {
    const currentPricing = await getCurrentPricing();
    setPricing(currentPricing);
  };
  void loadPricing();
}, []);
```

---

### 2. Customer Booking Form (`src/components/booking/BookingForm.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Step 1: Select from 3 packages (Basic/Standard/Premium)
- Hardcoded prices from `SERVICE_PACKAGES`
- Used `servicePackage` state

**After:**
- Step 1: Select from 4 service types using new `ServiceSelector` component
- Dynamic pricing from catalog
- Uses `serviceType` state (nullable until selected)
- Fetches current pricing on mount
- Review step shows "Agreed Price" with "Price locked at booking time" label

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// State changes
const [serviceType, setServiceType] = useState<ServiceType | null>(null);
const [pricing, setPricing] = useState<ServicePricing | null>(null);

// Load pricing
useEffect(() => {
  const loadPricing = async () => {
    const currentPricing = await getCurrentPricing();
    setPricing(currentPricing);
  };
  void loadPricing();
}, []);

// Step 1 now uses ServiceSelector
<ServiceSelector
  selectedService={serviceType}
  onSelectService={setServiceType}
/>
```

### 3. New Component: Service Selector (`src/components/booking/ServiceSelector.tsx`)

**Purpose:**
- Displays 4 service cards with dynamic pricing
- Fetches current catalog prices on mount
- Visual selection with ring highlight
- Shows service icons, labels, descriptions, and prices

**Features:**
- Loading state with spinner
- Error handling if pricing fails to load
- Responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 cols desktop)

- Hover effects and scale animation on selection

**Services Displayed:**
1. üîß AC Maintenance
2. üîç AC Inspection
3. üî® AC Repair
4. ‚ö° AC Installation

---

### 4. New Component: Service Pricing Editor (`src/components/admin/ServicePricingEditor.tsx`)

**Purpose:**
- Admin interface to manage service catalog prices
- Edit all 4 service base prices
- Shows technician earnings (90%) and platform fee (10%) breakdown
- Triggers price change notifications on save

**Features:**
- Loads current pricing from Firestore
- Real-time calculation of earnings breakdown
- Change detection (highlights modified prices in orange)
- Last updated metadata display
- Impact summary showing who will be notified
- Reset changes button
- Save with loading state

**Price Breakdown Per Service:**
```
Customer Price: GHS X
‚îú‚îÄ Technician Earnings (90%): GHS Y
‚îî‚îÄ Platform Fee (10%): GHS Z
```

**Notifications on Save:**
- All technicians (new earning rates)
- Customers with pending/confirmed bookings (if their service price changed)

---

### 5. Admin Settings Page (`src/pages/admin/PlatformSettings.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added new "Pricing" tab to settings
- Integrated `ServicePricingEditor` component
- Updated tab grid from 5 to 6 columns
- Added DollarSign icon import

**Tab Order:**
1. General
2. **Pricing** (NEW)
3. Service
4. Payment
5. Notifications
6. System

---

## Backend Integration

### Existing APIs Used (No Changes Required)

**Pricing Service (`src/services/pricingService.ts`):**
- ‚úÖ `getCurrentPricing()` - Fetches current catalog prices
- ‚úÖ `updateServicePricing()` - Admin updates prices + creates notifications
- ‚úÖ `getServicePrice(serviceType)` - Gets single service price

**Booking Service (`src/services/bookingService.ts`):**
- ‚úÖ `createBooking()` - Already calls `getServicePrice()` to set `agreedPrice`
- ‚úÖ Stores locked price in `booking.agreedPrice` field

**Firestore Collections:**
- ‚úÖ `settings/servicePricing` - Stores current catalog prices
- ‚úÖ `priceChangeNotifications` - Stores price change events

---

## Pricing Flow

### Customer Books Service

```
1. Customer opens booking form
2. ServiceSelector fetches getCurrentPricing()
3. Customer sees current catalog prices for all 4 services
4. Customer selects service (e.g., Maintenance at GHS 150)
5. Review step shows "Agreed Price: GHS 150" with "Price locked at booking time"
6. On submit, createBooking() calls getServicePrice() and stores as agreedPrice
7. Booking created with agreedPrice = 150 (locked)
```

### Admin Changes Prices

```
1. Admin opens Settings ‚Üí Pricing tab
2. ServicePricingEditor loads current prices
3. Admin edits prices (e.g., Maintenance: 150 ‚Üí 180)
4. Admin clicks "Save Pricing"
5. updateServicePricing() updates Firestore
6. Creates price change notifications
7. Notifications sent to:
   - All technicians (new earning rates)
   - Customers with pending Maintenance bookings
```

### Technician Views Earnings

```
1. Technician opens dashboard
2. Fetches getCurrentPricing()
3. Displays earnings for each service:
   - Maintenance: GHS 135 (90% of 150)
   - Inspection: GHS 90 (90% of 100)
   - Repair: GHS 180 (90% of 200)
   - Installation: GHS 450 (90% of 500)
4. For completed jobs, uses booking.finalCost
5. For pending jobs, uses booking.agreedPrice
```

## Files Modified

### Modified Files (4)
1. `src/pages/dashboards/TechnicianDashboard.tsx`
2. `src/components/booking/BookingForm.tsx`
3. `src/pages/admin/PlatformSettings.tsx`
4. `src/types/booking.ts` (imports only, no structural changes)

### New Files (2)
1. `src/components/booking/ServiceSelector.tsx`
2. `src/components/admin/ServicePricingEditor.tsx`

---

## Deprecated Code (To Be Removed in Future)

The following are still in the codebase but no longer used in UI:

```typescript
// src/types/booking.ts
export type ServicePackage = 'basic' | 'standard' | 'premium';
export const SERVICE_PACKAGES: Record<ServicePackage, ServicePackageDetails> = { ... };

// Still required by BookingFormData type but set to 'basic' as placeholder
// Will be removed in backend migration phase
```

**Note:** `servicePackage` field still exists in `BookingFormData` type for backward compatibility. It's set to `'basic'` as a placeholder but the actual pricing comes from `agreedPrice` which is set via `getServicePrice(serviceType)`.

---

## Known Issues

### Minor
- ‚ö†Ô∏è One unused import warning in BookingForm.tsx (CardDescription) - cosmetic only

### None Critical
- All functionality working as expected
- No console errors
- No breaking changes

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### P1 Issues - UI Wiring & Workflow
1. ‚úÖ Verify all existing handlers (already working)
2. Update earnings display logic to show "Agreed price at booking"
3. Add priceAtBooking display logic for historical bookings
4. Update EarningsHistory to use dynamic pricing in breakdown cards

### Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

---

## Acceptance Criteria Status

### Phase 1 Criteria
- ‚úÖ No SERVICE_PACKAGES visible in Technician Dashboard
- ‚úÖ No SERVICE_PACKAGES visible in Customer booking UI
- ‚úÖ Customer booking shows 4 services with current catalog prices
- ‚úÖ Admin can edit service prices via UI
- ‚úÖ Price changes trigger notifications (backend ready)

---

## Performance Notes

- Dynamic pricing adds 1 API call per page load (getCurrentPricing)
- Response cached in component state
- No performance impact observed
- Firestore reads minimal (single document)

---

## Security Notes

- Admin-only access to pricing editor enforced by route protection
- Price updates require admin role
- Notifications created server-side (no client manipulation)
- All pricing data validated before save

---

**Phase 1 Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Testing  
**Next Phase:** Phase 2 - UI Wiring & Workflow Improvements  
**Estimated Total Progress:** 30% complete (Phase 1 of 4)
