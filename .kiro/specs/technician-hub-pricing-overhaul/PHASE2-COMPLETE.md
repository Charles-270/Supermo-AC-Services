# Phase 2 Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Phase:** UI Wiring & Workflow Improvements  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Summary

Phase 2 successfully adds proper price display labels throughout the technician interface and updates all pricing displays to use dynamic catalog pricing instead of hardcoded values.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Job Detail Page (`src/pages/technician/JobDetail.tsx`)

**Enhancement:** Added contextual price labels

**Before:**
```typescript
<div className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-600 mb-2">
  {formatCurrency(earnings)}
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-green-700">
  Customer pays {formatCurrency(finalCost)}
</p>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<div className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-600">
  {formatCurrency(earnings)}
</div>
<div className="text-sm space-y-1">
  <p className="text-green-700">
    Customer pays {formatCurrency(finalCost)}
  </p>
  <p className="text-xs text-green-600">
    {booking.status === 'completed' 
      ? '‚úì Final amount paid' 
      : 'üìå Agreed price at booking'}
  </p>
</div>
```

**Impact:**
- Technicians now see clear indication whether price is final or agreed
- Completed jobs show "‚úì Final amount paid"
- Pending jobs show "üìå Agreed price at booking"

---

### 2. Earnings History Page (`src/pages/technician/EarningsHistory.tsx`)

**Major Updates:**

#### A. Dynamic Pricing in Breakdown Cards

**Before:**
- Used hardcoded `SERVICE_BASE_PRICING` constant
- Static prices never updated
- Card title: "Earnings Breakdown"

**After:**
- Fetches current pricing from `getCurrentPricing()` on mount
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Card title: "Current Earnings Rates"
- Added helpful note: "üí° These are current rates. Your completed jobs show the price agreed at booking time."

**New Features:**
```typescript
const [pricing, setPricing] = useState<ServicePricing | null>(null);
const [pricingLoading, setPricingLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadPricing = async () => {
    const currentPricing = await getCurrentPricing();
    setPricing(currentPricing);
  };
  void loadPricing();
}, []);
```

**Breakdown Cards Now Show:**
- üîß Maintenance: GHS 135 (from current catalog)
- üîç Inspection: GHS 90 (from current catalog)
- üî® Repair: GHS 180 (from current catalog)
- ‚ö° Installation: GHS 450 (from current catalog)

#### B. Enhanced Earnings Table

**Before:**
```typescript
<TableCell className="font-medium text-green-600">
  {formatCurrency(earnings)}
</TableCell>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<TableCell>
  <div>
    <p className="font-medium text-green-600">
      {formatCurrency(earnings)}
    </p>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
      From {formatCurrency(job.finalCost!)}
    </p>
  </div>
</TableCell>
```

**Impact:**
- Shows both technician earnings AND customer payment
- Makes it clear what the customer paid vs what tech earned
- Better transparency

---

### 3. Jobs List Page (`src/pages/technician/JobsList.tsx`)

**Enhancement:** Added earnings label

**Before:**
```typescript
<TableCell className="font-medium text-green-600">
  {formatCurrency(earnings)}
</TableCell>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<TableCell>
  <div>
    <p className="font-medium text-green-600">
      {formatCurrency(earnings)}
    </p>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
      Your share (90%)
    </p>
  </div>
</TableCell>
```

**Impact:**
- Clarifies that displayed amount is technician's 90% share
- Consistent with other pages

---

### 4. Service Catalog Component (`src/components/booking/ServiceCatalog.tsx`)

**Major Update:** Dynamic pricing integration

**Before:**
- Used hardcoded prices from `SERVICES` constant
- Prices never updated

**After:**
- Fetches current pricing on mount
- Maps service IDs to pricing keys
- Updates service cards with dynamic prices
- Shows loading state while fetching

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const [pricing, setPricing] = useState<ServicePricing | null>(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadPricing = async () => {
    const currentPricing = await getCurrentPricing();
    setPricing(currentPricing);
  };
  void loadPricing();
}, []);

// Map service IDs to pricing keys
const priceMap: Record<string, keyof ServicePricing> = {
  'install': 'installation',
  'maint': 'maintenance',
  'repair': 'repair',
  'inspect': 'inspection',
};

// Update services with dynamic pricing
const servicesWithPricing = pricing
  ? SERVICES.map(service => ({
      ...service,
      priceFrom: pricing[priceMap[service.id]],
    }))
  : SERVICES;
```

**Impact:**
- Customer booking flow now shows current catalog prices
- Prices update automatically when admin changes them
- No more stale hardcoded prices

## Price Display Logic Summary

### Completed Jobs
```
Display: finalCost (actual amount charged)
Label: "‚úì Final amount paid"
Technician Earnings: finalCost √ó 0.9
```

### Pending/Active Jobs
```
Display: agreedPrice (locked at booking)
Label: "üìå Agreed price at booking"
Technician Earnings: agreedPrice √ó 0.9
```

### Current Rates (Earnings Breakdown)
```
Display: Current catalog prices
Label: "Current Earnings Rates"
Note: "These are current rates. Your completed jobs show the price agreed at booking time."
```

### Customer Booking
```
Display: Current catalog prices (fetched dynamically)
Label: "From GHS X" (on service cards)
Locked: Price locked when booking is created
```

**Total:** 2 additional Firestore reads per user session (cached in component state)

---

## User Experience Improvements

- ‚úÖ Current earnings rates always up-to-date
- ‚úÖ See both customer payment and tech share
- ‚úÖ Helpful notes explaining pricing logic

### For Customers

**Before:**
- Saw hardcoded prices (potentially outdated)
- No indication prices would be locked

**After:**
- ‚úÖ See current catalog prices
- ‚úÖ Prices update when admin changes them
- ‚úÖ Clear "From GHS X" pricing
- ‚úÖ Price locked at booking time (backend)

---

## Known Issues

### None

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
