# UI/UX Redesign Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive UI/UX redesign of the multi-role platform application. The redesign aims to modernize the user interface, improve user experience across all user roles, and implement new design patterns generated from Google Stitch with accompanying code and images.

## Glossary

- **Platform**: The multi-role web application supporting customers, technicians, suppliers, admins, and trainees
- **User_Interface_System**: The frontend React components and styling that users interact with
- **Design_System**: The collection of reusable UI components, patterns, and guidelines
- **Role_Dashboard**: Specialized interface views for each user type (customer, technician, supplier, admin)
- **Google_Stitch_Assets**: The UI/UX designs, code snippets, and images generated from Google Stitch
- **Component_Library**: The collection of reusable React components following the new design system
- **Responsive_Layout**: Interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a modern and intuitive interface design, so that I can navigate and use the application more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. THE User_Interface_System SHALL use modern typography, color schemes, and spacing based on Google_Stitch_Assets
4. THE User_Interface_System SHALL maintain visual hierarchy that guides users through their tasks
5. THE User_Interface_System SHALL ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured component library based on the new designs, so that I can maintain consistency and reusability across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Component_Library SHALL include all UI components specified in Google_Stitch_Assets
2. THE Component_Library SHALL provide TypeScript interfaces for all component props
3. THE Component_Library SHALL include documentation and usage examples for each component
4. THE Component_Library SHALL support theming and customization options
5. THE Component_Library SHALL be organized in a logical folder structure for easy maintenance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the interface to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, so that I can access the platform from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Responsive_Layout SHALL adapt to screen sizes from 320px to 1920px and above
2. THE Responsive_Layout SHALL provide touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices
3. THE Responsive_Layout SHALL maintain functionality across all breakpoints
4. THE Responsive_Layout SHALL optimize content layout for each device type
5. THE Responsive_Layout SHALL ensure fast loading times on mobile networks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with a specific role, I want my dashboard to reflect the new design while maintaining role-specific functionality, so that I can efficiently perform my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their Role_Dashboard, THE User_Interface_System SHALL display the redesigned interface specific to their role
2. THE Role_Dashboard SHALL maintain all existing functionality while implementing new visual design
3. THE Role_Dashboard SHALL provide improved information architecture and task flows
4. THE Role_Dashboard SHALL include role-specific navigation and quick actions
5. THE Role_Dashboard SHALL display relevant metrics and data in an intuitive layout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions and interactions throughout the application, so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface_System SHALL provide smooth animations for page transitions and component interactions
2. THE User_Interface_System SHALL include loading states and feedback for user actions
3. THE User_Interface_System SHALL implement hover states and interactive feedback
4. THE User_Interface_System SHALL ensure animations do not interfere with accessibility
5. THE User_Interface_System SHALL maintain performance while providing enhanced interactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to ensure the redesign maintains all existing features and functionality, so that no business capabilities are lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface_System SHALL preserve all existing routes and navigation paths
2. THE User_Interface_System SHALL maintain all form functionality and data validation
3. THE User_Interface_System SHALL preserve all user permissions and role-based access
4. THE User_Interface_System SHALL maintain integration with existing backend services
5. THE User_Interface_System SHALL ensure all e-commerce and job management features remain functional

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved performance and faster loading times with the new design, so that I can work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface_System SHALL maintain or improve current page load times
2. THE User_Interface_System SHALL optimize image and asset loading
3. THE User_Interface_System SHALL implement efficient component rendering strategies
4. THE User_Interface_System SHALL minimize bundle size impact from new design assets
5. THE User_Interface_System SHALL provide progressive loading for complex interfaces
