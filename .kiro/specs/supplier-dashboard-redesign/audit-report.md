# Supplier Dashboard Redesign - Frontend Audit Report

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Scope:** UI/UX redesign of Supplier Dashboard (Overview, Manage Products, Settings)  
**Constraint:** Frontend-only changes; no backend/API/schema modifications

---

## Executive Summary

The Supplier Dashboard currently exists in **two conflicting implementations**:
1. **Legacy monolithic** `SupplierDashboard.tsx` (1890 lines) - currently routed in App.tsx
2. **New modular pages** (SupplierOverview, SupplierProducts, SupplierSettings) - NOT routed

The new pages use a modern layout system (SupplierLayout + SupplierSidebar) but are **not accessible** because routing still points to the old monolithic component.

---

## Current Architecture Issues

### P0 - Critical (Blocking)

#### 1. **Routing Mismatch**
- **Issue:** App.tsx routes `/dashboard/supplier` to old `SupplierDashboard.tsx`
- **Impact:** New redesigned pages (SupplierOverview, SupplierProducts, SupplierSettings) are unreachable
- **Expected Routes:**
  - `/dashboard/supplier` → SupplierOverview
  - `/dashboard/supplier/products` → SupplierProducts  
  - `/dashboard/supplier/settings` → SupplierSettings
- **Fix:** Update App.tsx routing to use new pages; remove old SupplierDashboard.tsx

#### 2. **Navigation Inconsistency**
- **Issue:** SupplierSidebar defines correct paths but they don't resolve
- **Impact:** Users cannot navigate between Overview, Products, Settings
- **Fix:** Ensure routing matches sidebar navigation items

---

## Page-by-Page Audit

### A) Overview Page (`SupplierOverview.tsx`)

#### ✅ Working Elements
- Policy banner (dismissible, uses local state)
- Low stock alert (dismissible, filters catalog correctly)
- Recent orders table with status badges
- Order action buttons (Mark Shipped, Mark Delivered)
- Loading states and error handling

#### ❌ Broken/Missing Elements

**P0 - Dead Controls:**
1. **"View all orders" button**
   - Current: `onClick={() => navigate('/dashboard/supplier/products')}`
   - Issue: Wrong path - should go to orders page, not products
   - Fix: Change to `/dashboard/supplier/orders` or `/orders` (if shared route exists)

**P1 - UX Issues:**
2. **No stats cards**
   - Screenshots show stats (Total Products, Low Stock, Pending Orders, Revenue)
   - Current: Stats are fetched but not displayed
   - Fix: Add stat cards above banners

3. **Limited orders display**
   - Current: Shows only 5 recent orders
   - Expected: Pagination or "View all" link to full orders page
   - Fix: Add pagination or link to dedicated orders view

**P2 - Responsive:**
4. **Table overflow on mobile**
   - Current: Table uses standard TableCell without responsive handling
   - Expected: Card layout on mobile (< 640px)
   - Fix: Add responsive card view for orders table

---

### B) Manage Products Page (`SupplierProducts.tsx`)

   - Fix: Add Duplicate action that pre-fills form with existing product data

5. **No "Adjust Stock" quick action**
   - Screenshots show Adjust Stock button
   - Current: Must open full Edit dialog to change stock
   - Fix: Add quick stock adjustment dialog (stock quantity only)

6. **No export/print functionality**
   - Expected: Export catalog to CSV or print view
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Fix: Add export button in header (optional P2)

**P2 - Responsive:**
7. **Table columns hidden on mobile**
   - Current: Uses `hidden sm:table-cell` for category

   - Fix: Either wire to existing endpoint or remove section if not implemented

**P1 - UX Issues:**
2. **No notifications section**
   - Screenshots show "Notifications" section
   - Current: Only Business Info and Payment Settings
   - Fix: Add Notifications section with email/SMS preferences

3. **No form validation feedback**
   - Current: No inline error messages
   - Expected: Red borders, error text for invalid fields
   - Fix: Add validation with error states (email format, phone format, etc.)

   - Expected: Prompt if form is dirty
   - Fix: Add beforeunload handler or navigation guard

---

## Accessibility Audit

### P0 - Critical A11y Issues

1. **Missing ARIA labels on icon buttons**
   - Location: SupplierProducts (Edit, Delete buttons)
   - Fix: Add `aria-label="Edit {productName}"` to icon buttons

2. **No keyboard navigation in dialogs**
   - Location: All dialogs (Link Product, New Product, Edit)
   - Issue: Tab order may escape dialog, no ESC handler
   - Fix: Ensure Dialog component traps focus, ESC closes

3. **Form inputs missing labels**
   - Location: SupplierSettings payment form
   - Issue: PasswordInput for account number may not have proper label association
   - Fix: Verify all inputs have `htmlFor` matching input `id`

### P1 - Important A11y Issues

   - Location: SupplierProducts status badges
   - Issue: Yellow "Low Stock" badge may not meet WCAG AA (4.5:1)

5. **No focus indicators on custom buttons**
   - Location: Sidebar nav buttons, table action buttons
   - Fix: Ensure `:focus-visible` ring is visible

6. **No aria-live regions for toasts**
   - Location: All pages using toast notifications
   - Fix: Verify Toaster component has `aria-live="polite"`

---

## Responsive Design Issues

### P0 - Mobile Breakpoints

1. **Tables don't convert to cards**
   - Location: SupplierOverview (orders), SupplierProducts (products)
   - Issue: Horizontal scroll on mobile
   - Fix: Add card layout for `sm` breakpoint (≤ 640px)

2. **Dialog content overflow**
   - Location: Link Product dialog (regions checkboxes)
   - Issue: Content may overflow viewport height on small screens
   - Fix: Add `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` to dialog content

### P1 - Tablet Optimization

3. **Sidebar width on tablet**
   - Issue: 256px sidebar takes too much space on 768px screens
   - Fix: Consider narrower sidebar or auto-collapse on tablet

4. **Form columns on tablet**
   - Location: SupplierSettings forms
   - Issue: 2-column layout may be cramped on 768px
   - Fix: Use single column on `md` breakpoint, 2 columns on `lg`

---

## Console Warnings/Errors

### P1 - React Warnings

1. **Potential key warnings in lists**
   - Location: SupplierProducts pagination, SupplierOverview orders
   - Check: Ensure unique keys (not array index) for mapped items

2. **Uncontrolled to controlled input warnings**
   - Location: Form inputs that may start as `undefined`
   - Fix: Initialize all form state with empty strings, not undefined

---

## Missing Features (from Screenshots)

   - Location: SupplierOverview
   - Expected: Click order row to see details
   - Status: No detail view implemented

---

## Data Contract Verification

### ✅ Confirmed Safe (No Backend Changes)

All pages use existing services:
- `getSupplierWithStats()`
- `getSupplierOrders()`
- `getSupplierCatalog()`
- `getSupplierProfile()`
- `updateSupplierProfile()`
- `addSupplierCatalogItem()`
- `updateSupplierCatalogItem()`
- `getStoreProductsForSupplier()`
- `updateOrderStatus()`
- `updateTrackingNumber()`
- `updateSupplierAssignmentStatus()`

No new endpoints, no schema changes, no auth modifications.

## Conclusion

The Supplier Dashboard redesign is **80% complete** but **not accessible** due to routing issues. The new pages are well-structured and use modern patterns, but require:

1. **Routing fixes** (P0) to make pages accessible
2. **Missing UI controls** (P0-P1) to match screenshot designs
3. **Responsive improvements** (P0) for mobile usability
4. **Accessibility fixes** (P0-P1) for WCAG AA compliance

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days for P0 fixes, 1-2 days for P1 enhancements.

**No backend changes required** - all fixes are pure UI/UX.
